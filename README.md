# Knn-and-j48-implementation-on-iris-in-r

Both the algorithms are implemented on iris dataset

This script will predict's the flower type for the new dimensions given

Sepal.Length,Sepal.Width,Petal.Length,Petal.Width are the four dimensions which are taken as input

The output is given as one of the flower name like setosa,versicolor,virginica based on the prediction.

Library's used
1. ggvis - to distribute data in a scatter plot
2. class - It contains the Knn model
3. gmodels - to build the crosstab
4. RWeka - Contains the j48 model

Thanks
